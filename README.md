# Simple Chatty bot using Python

# About
Creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own.

# Learning Outcomes
Youâ€™ll get to know the basic syntax of Python and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.

# Steps
-> Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console.
-> Introduce yourself to the bot.
-> Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age.
-> Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. And you are experienced enough to apply a for loop at this stage!
-> At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple-choice questions. Add some functions to your code and make the stage even better.
